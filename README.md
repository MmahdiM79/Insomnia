# Insomnia(not original version)

first of all, you can find the original version [here](https://insomnia.rest).


This was my AP(Advance Programming) course project of my university's second semester 2019 - 2020 (1398 - 1399). It is just a simple implementation of the insomnia app in java. you can use this project to send HTTP requests. supported methods are GET, POST, DELETE and PUT method. you can choose binary file, form data, or JSON for your request body kind. you can also save response and save and grouping requests.<br />
you can use this project on to ways. 
* 1: send request cross terminal (like [curl](https://curl.haxx.se))
* 2: use GUI 



## Installation

Just download the file of classes, put them on the same directory(the same folder).



## Usage

compile them(you must have JDK(Java Development Kit) on your system. you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk13-downloads.html)) 


compile step:
```bash
$ javac *.java
```


if you want to use the terminal version:
```bash

else if you want it with GUI:
